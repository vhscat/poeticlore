# **VHSCAT** ✨  

Welcome to **VHSCAT**, a digital archive of experiments, creations, and late-night coding wonders.  

## **Who am I?**  
- A **seriously non-serious poetic programmer**
- The human equivalent of a curious cat with too many tabs open  

## **What you’ll find here**  
- **Experimental tech & creative projects**  
- **Innovative ideas wrapped in elegant logic**
- **A mix of pixels, poetry, and programming**   

## **Guiding Philosophy**  
VHSCAT is where ideas grow, evolve, and sometimes completely transform. **Code isn’t just code—it’s an art form.**  

## **Status: Glamming up my life** 
> currently executing: glam_up_life()
> Work in progress. Always.
