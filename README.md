# **Poeticlore** ✨  
> _"Where code meets creativity, and logic dances with poetry."_  

Welcome to **Poeticlore**, a digital archive of experiments, creations, and late-night coding wonders.  

## **Who am I?**  
- A **seriously non-serious poetic programmer**  
- Lover of aesthetics, logic, and **a bit of mystery**   
- Writing code like it's poetry, crafting projects like they’re stories  

## **What you’ll find here**  
- **Experimental tech & creative projects**  
- **Innovative ideas wrapped in elegant logic**   
- **A touch of poetic chaos**—because why not?   

## **Guiding Philosophy**  
> _"Build. Break. Refine. Repeat."_  

Poeticlore is where ideas grow, evolve, and sometimes completely transform. **Code isn’t just code—it’s an art form.**  

## **Status: Glamming up my life** 
Work in progress. Always.
